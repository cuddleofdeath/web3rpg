# Web3RPG

Web3RPG is an on-chain experience being built by CuddleofDeath during Buildspace's Nights and Weekends Season 1 event.

Stay tuned for updates as this project will be built entirely in public.

## A note from the Project's creator, CuddleofDeath

I am building this project over the next 6 weeks to teach myself some new skills. My ultimate goal is to create a fun gaming experience with this. I believe I might start with a text-based game and will potentially explore adding assets in the future.

By the end of the Nights and Weekends program, I hope to have shipped a fun gaming experience filled with various choices, a funny set of classes, and so much more. Stay tuned for updates!

I hope to accomplish the end goal, and I would like to have this be an opensource project so that others who are interested can contribute at a later date, once the Nights and Weekends program ends.

## Available classes

Coming soon, stay tuned! These won't be your typical classes like Warrior, Mage, and Cleric.

## React

This is a ReactJS project created by using Vite.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
