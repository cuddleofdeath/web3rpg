# Web3RPG

Web3RPG is an on-chain experience being built by CuddleofDeath during Buildspace's Nights and Weekends Season 1 event.

Stay tuned for updates as this project will be built entirely in public.

## A note from the Project's creator, CuddleofDeath

I am building this project over the next 6 weeks to teach myself some new skills. My ultimate goal is to create a fun gaming experience with this. I believe I might start with a text-based game and will potentially explore adding assets in the future.

By the end of the Nights and Weekends program, I hope to have shipped a fun gaming experience filled with various choices, a funny set of classes, and so much more. Stay tuned for updates!

I hope to accomplish the end goal, and I would like to have this be an opensource project so that others who are interested can contribute at a later date, once the Nights and Weekends program ends.

## Available classes

Coming soon, stay tuned! These won't be your typical classes like Warrior, Mage, and Cleric.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
